# GoatBroteÂ²

A Discord bot that does things

## You need

Discord Go
`go get github.com/bwmarrin/discordgo`

Logrus
`go get github.com/Sirupsen/logrus`

Go Ini
`go get github.com/go-ini/ini`

## How to get this shit

If you want just the source code added to your **normal** Go

`go get github.com/DrBrobot/GoatBroteSquared/src/GoatBrote`

If you want to work with the way I set it up *weirdly*

`github.com/DrBrobot/GoatBroteSquared/`

You can update your packages if you do it my way with the batch file

###### It Just Works
