# GoatBroteÂ²

A Discord bot that does things and is poorly coded, please don't use it if you want to stay sane.

## You need

Discord Go
`go get github.com/bwmarrin/discordgo`

Logrus
`go get github.com/Sirupsen/logrus`

Go Ini
`go get github.com/go-ini/ini`

## How to get this shit

###### Download a binary

Go to releases up top and download the latest

###### Normal source code way

If you want just the source code added to your **normal** Go

`go get github.com/DrBrobot/GoatBroteSquared/src/GoatBrote`

Check the `config` folder in this git for the `example_bot.ini` file, rename it to `bot.ini` and change for your info

Also you need everything in the `images` folder for some commands

Warning, you need to set this up yourself

###### My weird setup that I use

If you want to work with the way I set it up *weirdly*

`go get github.com/DrBrobot/GoatBroteSquared/`

You can update your packages if you do it my way with the batch file

Build.bat will Build and Run the bot with the bot_dev.ini, which you can make your own by checking in `config` for the `example_bot.ini`

###### It Just Works
